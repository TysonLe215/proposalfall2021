# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fish Simulator



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A fishing game that prompts the user to click on fish to score points... those points will be used to purchase items from a fish shop.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My fishing game will consists of different stages. In order to progress through these stages, the player must pass a set amount of points. Every time the player reaches a certain threshold, the current stage is transformed as a new
background and set of fish are presented. At any time during the game, the player has the ability to buy "upgrades" in the bait shop. Most likely my program will consist of turtles, classes, functions, while loops, for loops, if statements, etc.



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am not planning on combining my final project with another course.



## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I have no collaborators.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for me is to call a class or sprite and have that class or sprite pass a certain threshold (if statement) to advance into the next stage.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is to add a specific coding to change the "look" of each new stage i.e. the background and new sprite models.



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A best outcome is to have a fully functioning game with little to no bugs/errors as you progess through the different stages or levels.



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be looking more into all the options that I can use in class function so I can understand the different possible outcomes I can make in my game. I will also be implementing the turtle feature in my program so I will do more
research in turtle and its functions. I will probably have to find a method to use while in the game, the player should be able to enter the bait shop at any point without it affecting the current state of the level. I will not
be working with others so I will be doing everything.
